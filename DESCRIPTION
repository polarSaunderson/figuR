Description: `figuR` is a personal package to easier customisation of figures. 
    It uses base R and graphics, but the functions use a syntax that I find more 
    unified and intuitive. It is thus more configurable whilst being essentially 
    the same. This is very experimental! Version0.1.0-rc1.
